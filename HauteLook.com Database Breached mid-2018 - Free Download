In mid-2018, the fashion shopping site HauteLook was among a raft of sites that were
breached and their data then sold in early-2019. The data included over 28 million
unique email addresses alongside names, genders, dates of birth and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes.

Who is HauteLook?

new sale events every morning. Launched in 2007, HauteLook is owned and operated by Nordstrom.
