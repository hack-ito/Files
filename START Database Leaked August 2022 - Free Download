In August 2022, news broke of an attack against the Russian streaming service "START".
The incident led to the exposure of 44M records containing 7.4M unique email addresses.
The impacted data also included the subscriber's country and password hash. START subsequently
acknowledged the incident in a Telegram post and stated that the data dated back to 2021.

I would like to warn users this leak is 77GB uncompressed and 6GB compressed.
