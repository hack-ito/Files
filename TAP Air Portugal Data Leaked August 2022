In August 2022, the Portuguese airline TAP Air Portugal was the target of a ransomware attack
perpetrated by the Ragnar Locker gang who later leaked the compromised data via a public dark
web site. Over 5M unique email addresses were exposed alongside other personal data including
names, genders, DoBs, phone numbers and physical addresses.
