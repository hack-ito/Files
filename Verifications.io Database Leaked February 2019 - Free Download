In February 2019, the email address validation service verifications.io suffered a data breach.
Discovered by Bob Diachenko and Vinny Troia, the breach was due to the data being stored in a
MongoDB instance left publicly facing without a password and resulted in 763 million unique email
addresses being exposed. Many records within the data also included additional personal attributes
such as names, phone numbers, IP addresses, dates of birth and genders. No passwords were included
in the data. The Verifications.io website went offline during the disclosure process, although
an archived copy remains viewable.

Compromised data: Dates of birth, Email addresses, Employers, Genders, Geographic locations,
IP addresses, Job titles, Names, Phone numbers, Physical addresses
