In February 2018, the diet and exercise service MyFitnessPal suffered a data breach.
The incident exposed 144 million unique email addresses alongside usernames,
IP addresses and passwords stored as SHA-1 and bcrypt hashes (the former for earlier
accounts, the latter for newer accounts). In 2019, the data appeared listed for sale
on a dark web marketplace (along with several other large breaches) and subsequently
began circulating more broadly.

Last June of 2019 a dehashed version of this database started circulating.
After verifying the data the info is correct and valid.
